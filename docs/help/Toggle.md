Toggle thread colors
====================
You may have to scroll/drag the thread diagram to make
the squares at the start of the threads visible.

Click these squares to toggle between a black or red color.
A tooltip shows a thread number when your mouse hovers over a square.

Too tiny squares or too close together? Use the zoom function of your browser.
Usually control-shift-plus to zoom in, control-zero to reset,
on a mac use command for control.
